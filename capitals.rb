# - Provide a welcome message to introduce the player to the game.
#
# - Initialize new keys in the hashes that store the number of times a user gets a capital `correct` and the number of times the answer is `wrong`.
#
# - Through all 50 states, prompt the user to name the capital of the state.
#  - If the answer is correct, display a message saying so, and increment the `correct` key.
#  - If the answer is wrong, display a message saying so, and increment the `wrong` key.
#  - After each prompt, display a message telling the reader how many times the state was answered correctly out of the total number of times answered.
#
# - Once the user has gone through all 50 states, ask them if they'd like to play again.
#
# ## Getting Started
#
# You're given an array of hashes that contain each state name and capital.
#
# > **Hint**: For the purposes of developing this program, start with a test array of three hashes so you don't have to play through all 50 states each time.
#
# ### Potentially Useful Methods
#
# - `puts`
# - `gets`
# - `.each`
# - `.sort_by`
# - `.shuffle`
#
# ## Bonus!
#
# - Calculate a overall total score, display a running tally for each prompt
# - If the user plays again, set the order of how the prompts appear to start with the ones they got wrong the most often.
# - Add a hint functionality that prints the first 3 letters of a capital
