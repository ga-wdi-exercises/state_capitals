# We're going to create a game to help us memorize the names of the capitals of all 50 states.
# Your program should prompt the user to identify the capital associated with a given state.
# There should be running tallies on the number of correct and incorrect answers.
# After getting through all 50 states one time, users should be asked whether or not they want to play again.
# As they continue, the prompts on states should appear in the order of the ones the user got wrong
# the most to least. You're given an array of hashes that contain each state name and capital.
# (Hint: For the purposes of developing this program, start with a
# test array of three hashes so you don't have to play through all 50 states each time.)

# *****psuedo code*****
# Display question to user
# Prompt user to answer question about state name
# User Answer capital = true gets point
# User Answer capital = false, loses point
