Learn State Capitals game

- Provide a welcome message to introduce the player to the game.

  puts "Welcome! Let's Learn the State Capitals!"

- Your program should prompt the user to identify the capital associated with a given state.

  puts "What is the capital of this state?"

  user_input = gets.chomp

  IF user_input = correct name of state capital
    move state to "correct" array
    puts "WOO!  You got it!"
  ELSE
    move state to "incorrect" array
    puts "Wah wah wah...that is wrong.""

  - Make sure the states don't appear in alphabetical order in the prompts. This will make the game a bit more challenging for the user.



- There should be running tallies on the number of correct and incorrect answers for each state

  - Initialize new keys in the hashes that store the number of times a user gets a capital `correct` and the number of times the answer is `wrong`.



- After getting through all 50 states one time, users should be asked whether or not they want to play again.
